 * @brief Compute the adapted parametric step given the wanted geometric distance
 * 
 * Given the 3D parametric curve described by f at p and a wanted geometric distance ds, 
 * computes the parametric step dp such that:
 *    |ds| = || f(p+dp) - f(p) || and (dp)(dp) > 0
 * 
 * To do so, it uses second order Taylor approximation around p to reduce the problem to finding
 * a root of a degree 4 polynomial. This root is found using Halley's method.
 * 
 * We assume the curve non 2-singular (that is both f' and f'' does not vanish).
 * (If it is the case, then the method falls back to returning dp = ds, and print an error to `stderr`).
 * 
 * @param ds Wanted geometric distance
 * @param f1d x value of f'(p)
 * @param f2d y value of f'(p)
 * @param f3d z value of f'(p)
 * @param f1dd x value of f''(p)
 * @param f2dd y value of f''(p)
 * @param f3dd z value of f''(p)
 * @return float The corresponding parametric step to take
